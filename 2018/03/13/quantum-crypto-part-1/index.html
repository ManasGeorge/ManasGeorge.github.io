  <h1 class="post-title">Quantum Crypto Part 1</h1>
  <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2018</span>
  <p>This is the first in a series of blog posts that make up my final report
for the Fall 2015 session of the Quantum Information and Quantum Computing
course offered at Georgia Tech. It is presented here as an reference for
theoretical Quantum Cryptography, as well as an increasingly
out of date survey of experimental methods in the field. This post introduces
the idea of Quantum Cryptography, and provides a brief overview of
traditional cryptography.</p>

<p>It was Feynman who, in 1982, proposed the idea of a universal quantum
simulator <a href="#Feynman1982">[1]</a>. The core idea was to use the inherent high
dimensionality of quantum mechanical systems in order to perform a large
number of computations in a short amount of time, which would allow such
simulators to trace the evolution of other quantum systems in a span of
time that could be considered practical. They can do this because of a
quantum mechanical concept superposition, wherein a single quantum
particle may be in two states at once. This means that a system of $n$
qubits can effectively occupy $2^n$ states, giving rise to the speedup
seen over classical computers. In this manner, the essential features of
quantum mechanics were shown to provide a way in which one could work
around the limitations imposed on us by quantum mechanics (the
difficulty of simulating quantum systems with and exponentially
increasing number of states).</p>

<p>The world as we know it today relies heavily on cryptography. The
ubiquity of access to the internet combined with the requirements of
trust imposed by the need for secure multi-party communication across
the globe present a problem that is solved quite naturally using
techniques from classical cryptography. Most of these tools have at
their heart a reliance on the difficulty (under present conditions of
mathematical and computational understanding) of solving certain
problems; known formally as the cryptographic hardness assumption. Some
of these problems include scaled up versions of common exercises given
to children in middle school: factoring an integer into its constituent
primes. Others involve tasks in more esoteric mathematical settings;
finding $e^{th}$ roots of a given number modulo a large number $N$ (The
RSA Problem), or finding the logarithm of an element of a group with
respect to another element of the group as a base (The Discrete
Logarithm Problem). Each of these problems has been studied extensively,
to the point where we can confidently say that for certain reasonable
parameters of the above problem, it is infeasible for an computationally
limited adversary to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time,
ensuring the security of the cryptographic system used<a href="#Zhu2001">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The development of fast quantum algorithms for a number of problems has
therefore posed an interesting challenge to the computational
assumptions made by cryptographers in analyzing cryptographic systems.
For instance, the RSA cryptosystem relies on the difficulty of finding
arbitrary roots of a number in a modular setting when the prime factors
of the modulus are not known. In general, this problem is easier than
integer factorization, which means that an efficient algorithm to
factorize integers will allow an efficient solution of the RSA problem -
it is almost trivial to find the required roots if the prime factors of
the modulus are known. Keeping this in mind, Shor’s success, in 1994, in
deducing a method by which an RSA modulus $N$ could be factored in
$O\left(lg(N)^{2+o(1)}\right)$ steps using a quantum computer of size
$O\left(lg(N)^{1+o(1)}\right)$ essentially sounded a death knell for the
RSA system<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="#Shor1995">[3]</a>. It is enlightening, perhaps, to step back
for a moment here and note that practical quantum computers of
sufficient size, reliability, and cost parameters that would allow RSA
to be broken even by state level actors are quite far off, and that the
importance of this result is mostly theoretical at the current time. On
the other hand, the prevailing mood in the cryptographic community is to
jettison a system as soon as any chink is discovered in its armor, and
so a cautious move away from using RSA in production systems is well in
order. To illustrate the seriousness of this problem, between $17\%$ and
$26\%$ of the top one million websites on the internet (as of January,
2014) support some variant of RSA in their security suites.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
Similarly, fast search algorithms like Grover’s eponymous construction
affect almost all cryptographic systems, although the degree to which
they are affected depends on the details of the system involved.
However, Compared to the massive speed up afforded by Shor’s algorithm
in the specific case of RSA, Grover’s algorithm is not nearly as
game-changing (It offers a search algorithm that takes
$\left(O\sqrt{N}\right)$ time, which, in practical terms, reduces the
effective security of the system used by half (Essentially making a
512-bit key only as secure as a 256-bit one)<a href="#Grover1996">[4]</a>. Shor’s
algorithm, on the other hand, decimates the security properties of RSA,
requiring keys on the order of $2^{b/2}$ bits in length to provide the
same level of security that a $b$ bit key would provide in the absence
of Shor’s algorithm, which is an intolerable cost for any practical
application.</p>

<p>In the theme of quantum phenomenon opening up new possibilities where it
closes old ones, the invalidation of a large portion of the existing
cryptographic infrastructure was somewhat alleviated by the discovery
that it was possible to use the quantum properties of microscopic
objects to transmit information between parties in a manner that is
essentially invulnerable to eavesdropping by a third party. The theory
surrounding this process will be the meat of this report, examining some
of the protocols that have been developed so far, the techniques used to
make them practical, and the security implications of some of the
features of quantum mechanics that allow us to do all of this with a
degree of certainty. Further, we examine experimental realizations of
the techniques described in the former half of the paper, providing a
measure of proof of the practicality of the notions covered. In
conclusion, we discuss some of the limitations of quantum channels and
possible directions future work in the area could take.</p>

<h1 id="history">History</h1>

<p>The story of cryptographic systems dates back to time immemorial. Humans
have kept secrets for as long as we’ve existed, and have tried to
communicate those secrets in a secure manner for as long as language
itself has existed. A number of solutions to this problem have arisen
over the years, although we shall skip most of the early development of
cryptosystems in favor of an overview of the modern cryptographic
infrastructure, beginning with a discussion of symmetric and asymmetric
cryptography.</p>

<p>We will use the notions of plaintext (the unencrypted message to be
transmitted), ciphertext (the encrypted message), and key (some short
string that, when combined with the plaintext in a rigorous manner
specified by an encryption algorithm, produces the ciphertext)
throughout.</p>

<h2 id="symmetric-and-asymmetric-cryptography">Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography</h2>

<p>At its core, the distinction between symmetric and asymmetric
cryptography refers to the type and purpose of the keys used. Symmetric
cryptography (also called private key cryptography) is characterized by
the use of a single key for both encryption and decryption. This
generally leads to the operations of encryption and decryption having a
much simpler algorithmic structure and requiring relatively small keys.
Furthermore, the operations involved are generally simple computational
primitives like the XOR (Exclusive-OR) operator, or some permutations of
the input, or bit shifts, among others. Both these factors contribute to
the relative speed and minimal computational cost of symmetric
algorithm. However, this can only be used when the sender and receiver
possess the same shared secret key before secure communication begins.
They may do this in a number of ways; physically meeting up to exchange
keys, sending keys by post, or using some other protocol to exchange
keys. This struggle to exchange keys is a microscopic reflection of the
larger problem of secure communication that cryptography tries to solve.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/quantum/symmetric.png" alt="" />
<em><a href="#MicrosoftCorporation2005a">[5]</a> The process of symmetric encryption</em></p>

<p>Asymmetric cryptography (also called public-key cryptography) involves
two keys; a public key and a private key. As the names suggest, the
public key is distributed publicly. It is not to be kept secret, and
anyone can gain access to it. The private key, on the other hand, must
be guarded at all times, as the security of the entire process relies on
this guarantee. There are two modes of operation, both of which have
their uses.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the first mode, the public key is used to encrypt a message,
which can then only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.
This ensures that anybody can send a message securely to the holder
of a particular private key, and rest assured that an eavesdropper
who intercepts the message will not be able to extract useful
information from it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second mode of operation is useful when you wish to ensure that
a particular message comes from a particular person; a signature of
sorts. Here, the private key is used to encrypt a message which can
only be decrypted by the corresponding public key. If you are able
to use Alice’s public key to decrypt a message sent to you, that
acts as a guarantee that the message was sent by Alice, since nobody
else has Alice’s private key, and hence would not be able to
generate a ciphertext that can be decrypted by Alice’s public key.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The algorithms used to implement asymmetric cryptographic protocols make
use of some rather heavy mathematical machinery, as a result of which
the techniques they give rise to are computationally more complex than
the techniques of symmetric cryptography. They are, therefore, more
useful when the messages involved are short in length.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/quantum/asymmetric.png" alt="" />
<em><a href="#MicrosoftCorporation2005a">[5]</a> The process of asymmetric encryption</em></p>

<p>This leads to a natural use of asymmetric algorithms in solving the
problem of key exchange we encountered above. Consider two parties,
Alice and Bob, who wish to communicate securely. Both parties have their
respective private keys $K_A$ and $K_B$, as well as their public keys
$P_A$ and $P_B$. It would be inefficient to directly use the
participants’ public and private keys to encrypt all communications
between them in an asymmetric manner, owing to the relatively large
computational cost of doing so. However, Alice can create a short random
string $S$, which she encrypts using her private key and sends to Bob.
Bob, who has Alice’s public key, can use it to decrypt Alice’s message
and recover the string $S$, which they can then use as a shared private
key to encrypt subsequent communications in an efficient manner using a
symmetric encryption algorithm. This description offers a high level
view of how symmetric and asymmetric algorithms work together to form
the basis of secure communications today, although a number of details
are absent (in particular, the problems of authenticating the
participants and of message integrity are not considered here, although
they are solved problems with well-known protocols).</p>

<h2 id="one-time-pad">One-Time Pad</h2>

<p>In most discussion of cryptography, the one-time pad is introduced
before more sophisticated ciphers, simply because it is considered more
fundamental, and because it’s operation is much simpler than the methods
discussed above. Here, it seems appropriate to discuss the one-time pad
and its security implications after discussing other ciphers, as it
allows for greater flexibility in contrasting the security properties of
the two. The discussion of the one-time pad is simplest in the case
where messages are simply bit streams of some length $n$. The
ciphertext, the plaintext, and the key are all of this form. Given this,
the key for a one-time pad is simply a perfectly random bit stream of
length $n$. The encryption procedure consists of generating, bit-by-bit,
the bitwise sum of the plaintext with the corresponding bit in the key,
a process that is equivalent to the bitwise addition modulo 2 of the two
bit streams. Given the random nature of the key, this is equivalent to
randomly flipping bits of the plaintext. To make the procedure clearer,
an example plaintext, key, and corresponding ciphertext are shown below:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
        \text{Plaintext }  & 0100101001011101110101 \\
        \text{Key }        & 1101101000110100110101 \\
        \text{Ciphertext } & 1001000001101001000000
    \end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>Decryption is just as simple; the exact same process is performed, using
the ciphertext and key as input this time. The preceding ciphertext is
reused in the following example:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
        \text{Key }        & 1101101000110100110101 \\
        \text{Ciphertext } & 1001000001101001000000 \\
        \text{Plaintext }  & 0100101001011101110101 
    \end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>At a high level, the security of the above scheme relies on the fact
that given a ciphertext $m$, it is possible that the ciphertext was
generated by any possible plaintext. Under the appropriate choice of
key, any plaintext encrypts to $m$. In fact, the required key is simply
the bitwise addition modulo 2 of the ciphertext and the target
plaintext. Therefore, there is no reason to prefer one plaintext over
another; every possible plaintext is equally likely to give rise to $m$
under the appropriate choice of key. An adversary that possesses only
the ciphertext has, in information-theoretic terms, no additional
advantage; he knows no more about the plaintext than he did before he
obtained the ciphertext. This property is formalized in a notion called
perfect secrecy, which only one time pads are have, as proved by Shannon
in his seminal paper <a href="#Shannon1949">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>The key property of the one-time pad, then, is this: the one-time is
<em>provably secure</em>, a property not shared by any other encryption scheme.
The most we can say about the symmetric and asymmetric methods
introduced above is that they have not yet been proven insecure, a very
important distinction, which leaves room for mathematical or other
theoretical breakthroughs to find insecurities in them. If mathematical
advances were to render trivial the problems whose difficulty public key
cryptography relies upon, for instance, all of the current key
distribution architecture would be rendered useless. The one-time pad is
similar to quantum key distribution in that when carried out properly,
quantum key distribution is provably secure; it is physically impossible
for an eavesdropper to obtain information about the derived shared key.
Of course, both security properties (in the one-time pad case as well as
the QKD case) rely on the correctness of the implementation of the
scheme. Mistakes in carrying out either protocol leave room for
disastrous consequences, in some cases completely destroying the safety
of the system used. For instance, a cardinal mistake in implementing a
one-time pad is key reuse. If the same key is used to encrypt multiple
messages, it becomes possible for an adversary in possession of multiple
ciphertexts encrypted with the same key to derive the key, breaking the
system completely. The security guarantee, then, rests on the single-use
property of keys. In practice, this requirement, combined with the fact
that one-time pad keys are as long as the message themselves, present an
almost insurmountable obstacle to their widespread use. If Alice and Bob
had some secure mechanism by which they could exchange one-time pad
keys, they could just as easily exchange the message itself, since the
key is just as long as the message. This is why, traditionally,
asymmetric key cryptography is implemented; it can be leveraged for key
exchange, after which the exchanged keys can be utilized in a symmetric
key scheme for secure communication. QKD provides a solution to this
quandary, enabling provably secure key exchange, which can then be used
to encrypt messages securely using the one-time pad. The combination of
QKD and one-time pads provides a provably secure form of encryption,
something previously thought to be a mere pipe dream and standing as an
ultimate stronghold of encryption that will weather theoretical
advances, whether mathematical or computational.</p>
