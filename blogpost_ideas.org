** TODO He and Xavier initialization 
*** DONE Math
    CLOSED: [2017-12-22 Fri 08:29]
    - Go through the math, explain why initializing that way equalizes variances, preventing the explosing/vanishing gradients problem
    - Paper link [[http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf][here]]
*** TODO Pictures
    - Sigmoid graph with saturation highlighted
    - Neural net diagram with notation marked
*** TODO Code
    - Write code to verify their results
    - Produce the histogram of gradients across layers comparing initialization function for each choice of activation function
** TODO Batch Normalization
   - Intuition for why re-scaling the inputs works
   - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf
** TODO Sparse Networks (FTRL)
   - Follow the regularized leader, also called Dual Averaging, as described in [[https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00508933/document][this]] mathematically hefty paper.
** TODO Dropout
   - Original Hinton [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.0580.pdf][paper]] here, more detailed [[https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf][paper]] here.
   - The basic idea is that it forces neurons to not be codependent.
** TODO Bottleneck layer
   - Show how adding a 1x1 window bottleneck layer effectively increases the complexity of features detected by the next conv layer
   - Use that paper that visualized the features learned by each layer
** TODO Traffic sign recognition
   - https://chsasank.github.io/keras-tutorial.html
   - See if you can get accuracy up?
* OS
** TODO Filesystem
   - Pick a filesystem, go through internals
   - Design decisions, data structures, how things fit together
** Kernel
*** TODO Linux scheduler evolution
    - Versions, history, motivations for each version, how things change
* Security
** TODO Side channel attacks
   - Dearth of material on how to actually conduct one, theory, etc.
** TODO Symbolic execution 
   - What SAT is, how to solve it, small z3 tutorial
   - Symbolic execution
* CTF problems
* Math
** TODO LLL
*** TODO RSA attacks
*** TODO Integer linear programming
*** TODO Integral relations
*** TODO MIMO
