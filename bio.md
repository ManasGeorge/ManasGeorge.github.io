Manas George
============

Pursuing Bachelor's in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.

Interested in figuring out what binaries do (Reversing), making computers look like they can think and learn (AI, Machine Learning), Cryptography, and Math. 

I enjoy [cubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube), doing [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) (mostly Jeopardy style), solving algorithmic puzzles, [crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com/), [math problems](https://projecteuler.net/), [science quizbowl](https://projecteuler.net/), hacking code together for fun.
