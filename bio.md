Manas George
============

Pursuing Bachelor's in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.

Interested in figuring out what binaries do (Reversing), making computers look like they can think and learn (AI, Machine Learning), Cryptography, and Math. 

I enjoy [cubing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube), doing [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) (mostly Jeopardy style), solving algorithmic puzzles, [crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com/), [math problems](https://projecteuler.net/), [science quizbowl](https://projecteuler.net/), hacking code together for fun.

The question of who I am is difficult to answer, so I’ll sidestep it by telling you what I like. I like puns and innuendo, satire that I don’t get at first and poetry that I connect with immediately. I like chocolate muffins, chocolate ice cream, chocolate melted in a cup and doused with spices. I like movies about love, about war, about things we want but can’t yet have. I like words like petrichor and occhiolism. I like the constant whoosh of air in a roller-coaster, a convertible, or on ice skates. I like typing so fast that the clickety clack clack of the keys remind me of the relentless chatter of Tommy gun ammunition. I like reading. I like reading about the same things I like watching movies about. I like reading things that disguise haute philosophy and hard science in the sugary shell of fiction. I like shivering in the cold, and sipping snow. I like tea and coffee, with and without milk, with and without sugar. I like Turing machines and Push Down Automata, the Hairy Ball theorem and the topological equivalence of coffee cups and doughnuts. I like Ed Sheeran’s guitar and George Ezra’s voice and Miles Davis’ trumpet. I like Gould humming in the back of the track to Bach. I like laughing. I like puzzles, and libraries with wood and leather and fireplaces. I like friends, and Friends. I like playful typography, playful dogs, playful anything, really. Now, if that hasn’t bored you, you might like some of the other things I’ve written, which is what this blog is for.
